INSTALLATION

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file to a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTE:** Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.

~~~
php yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migrations

php yii migrate

php yii rbac/init
~~~
